You may be wondering what's happening here.

This is, to be brief, my record of the 2017 Advent of Code.  Trying to stay on top of things and organized this year - with kids running around I'm not going to be hitting many leaderboards, but I might as well have something to show for my efforts.

To that end, I've set myself a bonus challenge - even if other techniques would be easier, I'm going to do every challenge in Python.  There's a few so far I could have probably grep'd through, but rules are rules.  It doesn't seem like much of a challenge, but on November 30th I didn't know any Python at all.  Learn by doing, as they say.

So that's the plan.  Twenty-five Python scripts, set up to solve all the challenges.  It's clumsy, but going well - surprisingly well, honestly.  I've commented out the fleeting idea to just import solveadventofcode - I should keep at least some challenge going.

Enjoy the code, enjoy the commentary!
